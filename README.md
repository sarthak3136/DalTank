# Dal Tank

The 'main' branch of our project integrates ten fully functional features, each diligently developed by individual members of our group. Each individual repository consists of individual features before merging into the main branch.

Our platform, Daltank, has been meticulously designed as a thriving marketplace for entrepreneurs, students, and investors alike. At the core of Daltank lies a dynamic arena where entrepreneurs and students can showcase their innovative business ideas, research proposals, and relevant specifics.

Investors, as a vital user category, sift through this plethora of business proposals and academic projects, tailor their exploration to align with their investment criteria, and directly engage with the respective entrepreneurs or students.

We have also integrated features such as idea submission for students, investor portfolio management, profile editing, notification updates via email through Node Mailer, rating and feedback system, and others that cater to user authentication and personalized experience. These features contribute to creating an enriched experience for all users, offering tools for collaboration, evaluation, feedback, and connectivity.

The result is Daltank: a streamlined conduit between idea generators, academics, and potential financiers. It fosters a collaborative, transparent, and potentially lucrative environment for all parties involved. With its ten unique features, Daltank serves not only as a hub for innovation but also as a catalyst for growth, connecting vision with the resources needed for realization.

## Deployment

The deployment process unfolds in several distinct stages as outlined below:

1. First, commit the updated code and push the alterations to the remote repository on GitHub. This ensures all changes are synchronized and stored on a remote server.

2. Following this, execute the backend deployment on Render, effectively activating the server-side operations of the application.

3. In the third stage, transition the local connection links to the deployed link within the frontend. This alteration enables the user-facing side of the application to communicate effectively with the server.

4. Subsequently, carry out the frontend deployment. This activates the user-interface elements and ensures they can interact correctly with the backend.

5. Next, establish the build configuration. This involves designating the path from which the code will be built and specifying the build command. These settings streamline the construction of the deployable application package.

6. Upon successful completion of the build, the application is ready for viewing. Use the generated link to access and test the hosted application, verifying its functionality in the live environment.
